# Gotur

My teammate and I completed this project in the context of the class "Database Management Systems and Big Data", which is part of the Master's degree in Big Data and Business Analytics I am following.

The goal of the project was to create a database based on a fictional grocery shopping app called Gotur - an app where customers can order any kind of grocery products from the nearest store.
